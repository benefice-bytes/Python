1. define an empty class
    i) create two instances of the class
    ii)print each instance
2. add some fields(first,last,pay,email) to the instance
    i) print the instance fields
    observation: it will be more difficult to add each field to the instance, and accessing
    them.
3. create employee class, with constructor(first, last,pay) 
    i) constructor creates email field
    ii) create instance, by invoking the construtor.
   iii)add fullname() method, which returns "{} {}".format(first, last)
   iv) why 'self' is positional argument to each method. what is the background of 
         method calling on each object ?
    iv)observation both are some... do the following
        emp_1.fullname()
        Employee.fullname(emp_1)
    background:- emp_1.fullname() converted as Employee.fullname(emp_1), that's why
     def fullname(self):

1. how to define an empty class
2. how to define a constructor, and how it will be called.
3. why each method first positional argument is 'self'
