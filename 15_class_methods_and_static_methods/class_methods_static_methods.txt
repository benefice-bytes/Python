1. Explore the difference between regular method, class method, and static method.

    i)regular or instance methods are defined with first argument as 'self'.

   ii)class method, signature is...
       @classmethod #decorator
        def set_raise_amount(cls, amount):
               cls.raise_amount = amount # here raise_amount is class variable

   iii) what are scenario's class methods are useful
         a) update class variables data
         b) class methods are useful in creating instances, other than constructors.
              so, here class method looks like a factory method.

    iv) regular (or) instance methods, pass instance automatically, instance is assigned 
         to 'self' argument.

    v) class methods pass automally, the class name, and assigned to 'cls' argument

    vi) static methods will not pass anything.
    vii) static methods are useful in coding utilities. static methods don't operate on instance
           or class.
           for ex:- Employee class has a satic method, which checks a given day is
                        workday or not!!!
