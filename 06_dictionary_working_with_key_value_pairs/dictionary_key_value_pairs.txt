1. create a dictionary with name,age,course as keys
    i). print dictionary
   ii). read value from dict, using key
  iii). read value from dict, using key, which is not existed
        observation: throwing exception
  iv). read value from dict, using get method
   v). read value from dict, using get method (which is not existed key)
        observation: returns None. (no exception)
  vi). read value from dict, using get(key, 'not found') (which is not existed key)
        observation: returns 'not found' (no exception)
2. update value, using key
3. update multiple key/value pairs using update(...) method
4. pop a key from dict
    i). read popped key from dict.
5. len(dict). observation: length of dictionary (no.of keys in dict)
6. get all keys of dict
    a) get all values of dict
    b) items(), which returns (key,value) tuples as a list
7. loop through all keys
    a) loop through key,value pairs from dict
