1. What is class variable and instance variable?
2. I have a class variable, I'm updating the value of class variable as..
    i). Employee.variable += 1
   ii). self.variable += 1
   explain the above scenario.
###################################
a class variable, will be shared among instances.
by default class variable is class specific means only one copy available.

if any instance overrides class variable value, that instance will get a copy of the class variable, and class variable value is not applicable that instance. rest of the instances of 
that class, still share the class variable.
